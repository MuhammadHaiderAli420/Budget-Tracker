## üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

The backend uses MongoDB with Mongoose to manage persistent data. The following collections are implemented:

- **User**: Stores account information, including full name, email and a securely hashed password using bcrypt. Additional fields include profileImageUrl, isAdmin, and timestamps.

- **Income**: Stores income records linked to users. Each record includes userId, source, amount, date, icon, Recurring, Recurring Type, Pinned and timestamps.

- **Expense**: Stores expense records linked to users. Each record includes userId, category, amount, date, notes, icon, Recurring, Recurring Type, Pinned and timestamps.

### Additional Features

- **Validation**: Enforced at the schema level for all models, including required fields, format validation, numeric constraints, and string trimming.
  
- **Relationships**: Income and Expense reference the userId using Mongoose ObjectId and ref.

- **Seeding**: A `seed.js` script is available to insert a sample user, multiple income and expense records for testing purposes.

- **ERD Diagram**: Located in `/Backend/Docs/ERD.png`, visualizing the relationships and schema design.

Testing Procedures

- Manual test cases were written to validate all operations.
- New test cases cover:
